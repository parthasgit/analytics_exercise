# analytics_exercise
Some code I wrote to perform an analytics exercise

The exercise was as follows:

You will find Q2 regression data from the link above. (link not included) 

The data contains 300 rows and 3 columns (from the left, A, B, and C). Please build a good regression model which explains column C by a function of  A and B. 

Note: Please do not use any ML libraries or packages. You can simply attach plot of data points and your regression model that fits the data points and of course, code point (preferably Github).

The data has been included in this repo as regressionData.csv

I have included the jupyter notebook I used for my analysis - as well as the code as a script, depending on which one is preferable.
